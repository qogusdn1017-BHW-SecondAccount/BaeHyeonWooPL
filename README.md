# BaeHyeonWooPL
Minecraft BaeHyeonWoo Plugin for me. Created By BaeHyeonWoo.

## WARNING : THIS CODE IS NOT FULLY COMPLETED

THE PLUGIN CODE IS EDITING BY HappyAndJust. FEEL FREE TO EDIT THE CODE. BUT REMEMBER THAT THIS CODE HAS A BUG AND ERRORS AND MAY CAUSE ISSUES IN-GAME LIKE I SAID EARLIER ; CODE IS NOT FULLY COMPLETED.

##

THE BUGS ARE : COMMANDS DON'T WORK WHILE 'isOp()' IS IN THE CODE.

THE FEATURE THAT I THINKING BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO : CHANGING OTHERS' GAMEMODES.
